    "# Introduction to ExoCTK\n",
    "Authors: Jules Fowler, Joe Filippazzo, Matthew Bourque, Kevin Stevenson\n",
    "\n",
    "The Exoplanet Characterization Tool Kit (ExoCTK) is an open source Python 3.5+ package that serves as a one-stop-shop for observation planning, data reduction, and scientific analysis of transiting exoplanet systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover the installation of the software as well as an end-to-end example that demonstrates the core functionalities of each tool provided by the ExoCTK package.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation\n",
    "You must first have a working installation of ``anaconda`` or ``miniconda`` for Python 3.  If you do not yet have this on your system, you can visit the following links for download and installation instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\n",
    "- [Miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the latest `exoctk` package with the necessary environment files, you should clone the repository directly from GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ExoCTK/exoctk.git\n",
    "cd exoctk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the `exoctk` data, visit the shared [ExoCTK DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p9c49urdbkmn5rz/AACFIjeAphOPqcCLtqd1v_W9a?dl=0), download the folders, and unzip them into a directory called `exoctk_data/`.  You may need to download  `modelgrid` seperately because it's the largest of the bunch and some computers have trouble with large .zip files.  Next, export an environment variable for `EXOCTK_DATA`. For Mac OS/Linux, add the line\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export EXOCTK_DATA='/path/to/your/unzipped/directory/exoctk_data/'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`. Don't forget to execute your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to implement the changes in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "source ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows, add an evironment variable using System Utility. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install the ExoCTK `conda` environment via the `env/environment-<PYTHON_VERSION>.yml` files (relative to the parent directory of where the `exoctk` repository was installed).  Note that there are separate environment files for each version of `python` that `exoctk` supports.  For this demo, we will be using version 3.6. Ensure that `conda` is up to date, create the `exoctk` environment with Python version 3.6, and activate it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda update conda\n",
    "conda activate base\n",
    "conda env create -f env/environment-3.6.yml\n",
    "conda activate exoctk-3.6\n",
    "conda install ipykernel\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name exoctk-3.6 --display-name \"exoctk-3.6\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, install `exoctk` by running the `exoctk` setup script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python setup.py install\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Kernel\n",
    "Before getting started, make sure that you are using the `exoctk-3.6` kernel be selecting it via `Kernel` -> `Change kernel`.\n",

For this end-to-end demonstration, let's ask a simple question: \"Where's the methane?\"  More specifically, we want to know if planets with Teq < 1000 have methane in their atmospheres, as predicted by chemical equilibrium models.\n",

    "\n",
    "To plan an observation with APT, an observer needs to calculate the groups and integerations required for their observation. Each JWST observation consists of some amount of overhead (time to reset the detector, etc), and a discrete number of integrations, each made up of 'n' frames. For time-series observations, there is always only one frame per group, so each integration also has 'n' groups.  The total observation time is determined by the frame time of your given instrument and mode, the number of groups per integration, and the number of integrations in your exposure.  An observation with too many groups per integration will saturate the detector, but too few groups per integration will lead to inefficient observations (i.e. low duty cycles). \n",
